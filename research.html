			<h2>Secondary Research</h2>

			<h3>Health Problems in South Africa</h3>
			<p>6% of the population suffers from diabetes
				5 million more suffer from pre-diabetes (3.5 million people)
				Diabetes and Heart disease are among the highest 3 causes of
				death in South Africa.
				Lack of sufficient physical activity and unhealthy eating habits are the
				main reasons these two health issues are so prominent in South Africa.
				They more problematic in low income households and poverty-stricken
				areas where people are not aware of the health dangers and/or do not
				have the finances to support themselves if diagnosed.
				Research shows that physical inactivity increases the risk of a heart
				attack or stroke by 50% and even more likely for someone diagnosed
				with diabetes. Unfortunately, most underprivileged schools in south
				Africa don't generally accommodate outdoor activities and physical
				education.
				Diabetes and heart problems in south Africa are directly related to bad
				eating habits. Moreover, high calorie processed foods and items with a
				large amount of sugar are more easily accessible as they sell for lower
				prices.
				This problem continues to prevail in the government's financial
				direction towards preventing TB and HIV/AIDS, leaving Diabetes and
				heart disease with little to no funding. Therefore, children in
				underprivileged schools are more susceptible to these diseases in
				unhealthy</p>

				<h3>Poverty and Academic Potential</h3>
				<p>55.5% of south Africans are living in poverty (30.5 million people).
					51% of the South African youth (18-21 years of age) claimed that
					they did not have the financial means to pay tuition
					18% were not attending school because of lack of academic
					performance
					This is evident where the poorest of learners depend on dysfunctional
					public schooling with unreliable teachers in an environment which
					generally lacks discipline and safety. As a result, many of these learners
					achieve poor outcomes. Moreover, gangsterism and violence are
					prominent in the township and poorer household areas. This affects
					children's self-confidence, self-assurance and directs their attention
					and emotions to subjects that are not inducive to learning. This is
					alarming to South Africans as this deprives individuals of the necessary
					skills and marks to get a job, contributing to the increasing
					unemployment rates and crime in order to support families.
					This issue continues to prevail not only because of the lack of authority
					and education standards of some of the teachers in these schools, but
					also the students fear and lack of self-confidence.</p>

					<h3>Leadership Figures</h3>
					<p>between 61.8% and 64.1% of South African children grow up in
						households without a father.
						The sources of most of the problems faced in South Africa are a result of
						lack of great leadership figures. South African leaders have created the
						"personal rule paradigm" where they have treated their position for
						personal gain and accumulation of wealth. Their influence as leaders in
						politics and institutions paints a faulty definition of what it means to be
		a person with power. This is alarming as it imposes the mindset
						personal gain rather than lead by example.
						According to Drescher, there are seven things that a child needs that
						they get from having a positive relationship with their father; Security,
						significance, acceptance, love, praise, discipline and God. This lack of
						good leadership prevails as it is in a vicious cycle where children are not
						being taught the true meaning of servant leadership and are not
						receiving fatherly leadership. This increases violence, insecurities and
						hope.
						This lack of good leadership prevails as it is in a vicious cycle where
						children may not be being taught the true meaning of servant
						leadership and or receiving fatherly leadership. This increases violence,
						insecurities and hope. These affect the whole of South Africa because it
						represses the potential for a better south Africa in the future by
						disadvantaging our children and youth.</p>
