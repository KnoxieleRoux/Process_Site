					<h2>Interview with Tian Venter</h2>
						<p>I had an interview with founder Tian Venter to talk about Umoya, his heart for the program and website. One of the things I gathered from the interview was that the website originally functioned and revolved around the MTB project, supporting local programs and connecting with Donors, volunteers and financial partners. </p>
						<p>Tian talked about conveying an initial feeling of transparency on the website. Moreover, He talked about feeding the children of Africa with hope and encouragement, giving them mentorship and belief. This is the heart of the organization and is at the center of why Umoya started in the first place.</p>

					<h2>Interview with Andre le Roux</h2>
					<p> Andre le Roux is one of the founding members of Umoya and he runs the financial and administrative side of things, but he is also a user. Andres Company, BISA, donates a percentage of their profits to Umoya and receives tax benefits and being recognised as a good corporate citizen in return. This can be used to gain more investors like BISA.</p>
					<p> In chatting with Andre, I realized the importance of the vision with the schooling system. Moreover, the MTB and mentorship program was important to giving the children hope, but the resources that give them opportunities in the classroom are still not 100% there. Umoya still needs to get more funds in order to be able to provide children with the education to get them out of the poverty cycle.</p>
					<p>Another interesting thing that HE talked about, was how they are actively searching for individuals who have maybe risen above the poverty cycle, have a love for Mountain Biking or some other sport, who might be interested in taking 2-3 boys under their wing. Through Umoya, they will be able to make a meaningful difference and serve as positive influences.</p>
					<p>With regards to the website, Andre expressed an excitement for the existing colors on the website, and that the bright colors on the clothing brought about empowerment and recognition. Moreover, he suggested that a “testimonials” section would be a great way to be transparent, while giving personal introspection into what they are doing at Umoya, as well as how people can get involved.</p>
